Page Recorder FirefoxDevTools add-on
====================================

pagerecorder is a really bad name but naming things is hard.

This is a Firefox DevTools add-on that records changes on the current page.
Start it and it will record DOM mutations and events, plus it will remember the state of the page and the target node for each change.

Stop it and it will list those changes in the toolbox so that you can mouseover them and see what happened in the page while it was being recorded.
